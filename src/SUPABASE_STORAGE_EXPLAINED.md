# Supabase Storage: Why You See 0 Requests

## TL;DR
**This is completely normal!** Your Go Sintra website doesn't use Supabase Storage - it uses the Supabase Database (specifically the `kv_store_3bd0ade8` table).

## What You're Seeing

In your Supabase dashboard, you see:
- **Storage Requests: 0** ✅ Expected!
- **Database Queries: Many** ✅ This is what you should be seeing!

## Why 0 Storage Requests?

### Supabase Has Two Different Systems:

1. **Supabase Storage** (S3-like blob storage)
   - Used for: Large files, images, videos, PDFs
   - Your site: NOT USING THIS
   - Dashboard shows: 0 requests ✅

2. **Supabase Database** (PostgreSQL)
   - Used for: Structured data, key-value pairs, relational data
   - Your site: USING THIS via `kv_store_3bd0ade8` table
   - Dashboard shows: Active queries ✅

## What Your Site Actually Uses

### Database Table: `kv_store_3bd0ade8`

This is a **key-value store** table in PostgreSQL with this structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE kv_store_3bd0ade8 (
  key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value JSONB
);
```

### What's Stored in the Database:

| Key | What It Stores |
|-----|----------------|
| `website_content` | Simple website content (from AdminPage) |
| `comprehensive_content` | Advanced website content (from ContentEditor) |
| `pricing_config` | Pricing for passes, tours, attractions |
| `availability_YYYY-MM-DD` | Seat availability for each date |
| `booking_current_prefix` | Current booking ID prefix (AA, AB, etc.) |
| `booking_used_prefixes` | List of all used prefixes |
| `AA-0001`, `AA-0002`, etc. | Individual booking records |
| `checkin_AA-0001_0` | Check-in records for passengers |
| `checkins_YYYY-MM-DD` | All check-ins for a date |
| `chat_conversation_xxx` | Live chat conversations |
| `chat_messages_xxx` | Live chat messages |
| `pickup_request_xxx` | Pickup requests |
| `db_initialized` | Database initialization flag |

## When Would You Use Supabase Storage?

You would use Supabase Storage if you needed to:
- Store user-uploaded images
- Store large PDF files (currently PDFs are generated on-the-fly)
- Store video content
- Store any files > 1MB

## Current Architecture

```
Frontend (React)
    ↓
Edge Function (Hono Server)
    ↓
kv_store.tsx (utility layer)
    ↓
Supabase Database (PostgreSQL)
    ↓
kv_store_3bd0ade8 table
```

**NOT USED:**
```
Supabase Storage (blob storage)
```

## How to Check Your Data

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to **Table Editor** (not Storage!)
2. Find table: `kv_store_3bd0ade8`
3. You should see rows with keys like:
   - `website_content`
   - `comprehensive_content`
   - `pricing_config`
   - Booking IDs (e.g., `AA-0001`)
   - etc.

### Option 2: SQL Editor
```sql
-- See all keys
SELECT key FROM kv_store_3bd0ade8 ORDER BY key;

-- Count total rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM kv_store_3bd0ade8;

-- Check for duplicates
SELECT key, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM kv_store_3bd0ade8 
GROUP BY key 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Option 3: Diagnostics Tool
1. Go to: Admin → Diagnostics
2. Click "Run Diagnostics" in the Database Diagnostics section
3. It will show you:
   - Total unique keys
   - Total rows
   - Any duplicates (should be none)

## Summary

| Metric | Expected Value | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Storage Requests | 0 | ✅ Not using blob storage |
| Database Queries | Many | ✅ Using database table |
| Table `kv_store_3bd0ade8` | Has rows | ✅ Data is being saved |
| "Duplicate" warnings | Some | ✅ Normal upsert behavior |

## Still Concerned?

If you want to verify everything is working:

1. **Check the table exists:**
   - Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor
   - Look for `kv_store_3bd0ade8`

2. **Check data is being saved:**
   - Admin Panel → Content Manager
   - Make a change and save
   - Go to Supabase → Table Editor → `kv_store_3bd0ade8`
   - Look for key `website_content`
   - Check the timestamp in the value

3. **Run diagnostics:**
   - Admin → Diagnostics → Database Diagnostics
   - Click "Run Diagnostics"
   - Should show your keys and rows

## Questions?

- **"Should I enable Storage?"** No need unless you want to store large files
- **"Is my data being saved?"** Yes, in the database table, not in Storage
- **"Why 0 storage requests?"** Because you're not using Storage (and that's fine!)
- **"Is something broken?"** No, everything is working as designed!
