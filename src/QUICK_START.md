---

## 📋 Two-Minute Deploy

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (30 seconds)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update config: Change output to Build directory"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Vercel (3-5 minutes)

Vercel automatically detects your push and starts building.

**Watch it happen:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Watch the progress bar

### Step 3: Verify (1 minute)

When deployment completes:

1. ✅ Status shows "Ready"
2. ✅ Click the deployment URL
3. ✅ Your site loads!

---

## 🎯 That's It!

**Total time:** ~5 minutes

**What happens automatically:**
- Vercel reads the updated `vercel.json` ✅
- Runs `npm install` ✅
- Runs `npm run build` ✅
- Creates `Build/` folder ✅
- Deploys your site ✅
- Makes it live ✅

---

## 🧪 (Optional) Test First

Want to be extra sure? Test the build locally:

```bash
npm run build
```

If this creates a `Build/` folder, you're good to go!

## ❌ If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check build logs** in Vercel (click the deployment)
2. **Look for the error message**
3. **See**: [`VERCEL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](./VERCEL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
