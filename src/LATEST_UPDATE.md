- Server response (TTFB)

üë• **User Insights**
- Unique visitors
- Geographic location
- Device types (mobile/desktop)
- Session duration
- Bounce rate

### Privacy-First

Perfect for your guest-only site!

## How to Deploy

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs the new `@vercel/analytics` package.

### Step 2: Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel Analytics tracking"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment

Vercel will automatically:
1. Install dependencies
2. Build your app with Analytics
3. Deploy to production
4. Activate analytics tracking

**Time:** 3-5 minutes

## Viewing Your Analytics

### 1. Access Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your **Go Sintra** project
3. Click the **"Analytics"** tab

### 2. Enable Analytics (if needed)

If you don't see the Analytics tab:
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Click "Analytics"
3. Click "Enable Analytics"

### 3. View Real-Time Data

After deployment, you'll see:
- **Overview:** Traffic trends and top pages
- **Real-time:** Current active users
- **Audience:** Geographic and device data
- **Web Vitals:** Performance scores

## What Gets Tracked

### Every Page

All your routes are automatically tracked:
- ‚úÖ Home page (`/`)
- ‚úÖ Attractions (`/attractions`)
- ‚úÖ Individual attractions (`/attractions/pena-palace`)
- ‚úÖ How It Works (`/how-it-works`)
- ‚úÖ Buy Ticket (`/buy-ticket`)
- ‚úÖ Blog articles (`/blog/article-slug`)
- ‚úÖ About, Terms, Privacy pages
- ‚úÖ Booking confirmation
- ‚úÖ Manage booking portal

### Performance Metrics

Collected for every page load:
- **LCP** - How fast main content loads
- **FID** - How quickly users can interact
- **CLS** - How stable the page is visually
- **FCP** - How fast first content appears
- **TTFB** - How fast server responds

### User Data

Anonymous insights:
- Number of visitors per day/week/month
- Which pages are most popular
- Where visitors are from (country/city)
- What devices they use
- How they found your site

## Cost

### Free Tier (Included)
- ‚úÖ 2,500 events/month
- ‚úÖ 30-day data retention
- ‚úÖ All core features
- ‚úÖ Real-time data
- ‚úÖ Web Vitals

This should be **more than enough** for your site during development and initial launch.

### Pro Tier (Optional)
If you exceed the free tier:
- 100,000 events/month
- 90-day data retention
- Custom events
- Data export
- Advanced filters

## Testing

### Local Development

Analytics **won't work locally**. It only activates when deployed to Vercel production.

To test locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

But you won't see real analytics data until deployed.

### After Deployment

1. Visit your site at the Vercel URL
2. Navigate to a few pages
3. Wait 5-10 minutes
4. Check Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Analytics
5. You should see your test visits!

## Verification Checklist

After deploying, verify:

- [ ] Deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Site loads at Vercel URL
- [ ] Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
- [ ] Navigate pages, look for requests to `vitals`
- [ ] Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Analytics
- [ ] See "Analytics Active" status
- [ ] Wait 10 minutes, refresh dashboard
- [ ] See your page views appear

## Advanced: Custom Events (Optional)

Want to track specific actions beyond page views? You can add custom events:

```typescript
import { track } from '@vercel/analytics';

// Track when user purchases a ticket
track('TicketPurchased', {
  passType: 'full-day',
  quantity: 2,
  totalAmount: 50
});

// Track booking flow steps
track('BookingStepCompleted', {
  step: 'ticket-selection'
});

// Track language changes
track('LanguageChanged', {
  from: 'en',
  to: 'pt'
});
```

Add these to your components where these actions happen (e.g., in `BuyTicketPage.tsx`, `StripePaymentForm.tsx`).

## Files Modified

### Modified
1. **`/package.json`** - Added `@vercel/analytics` dependency
2. **`/App.tsx`** - Imported and added `<Analytics />` component

### Created
3. **`/VERCEL_ANALYTICS_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide
4. **`/LATEST_UPDATE.md`** - This file!

### Updated Documentation
5. **`/TL;DR.md`** - Added analytics info
6. **`/README.md`** - Added analytics link
7. **`/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`** - Added analytics guide

## Integration Details

The `<Analytics />` component is placed at the root level of your app, right before the closing `</div>`:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen flex-col">
      {/* All your app content */}
      
      <Toaster position="top-center" richColors />
      <Analytics />  {/* ‚Üê Added here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This ensures analytics tracks:
- ‚úÖ All page navigations
- ‚úÖ All user interactions
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics for every page
- ‚úÖ Session data for all visitors

## Troubleshooting

### "Not seeing analytics data"

**Solution:** Wait 5-10 minutes after deployment. Data isn't instant.

### "Analytics tab not in dashboard"

**Solution:** 
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Click Analytics
3. Click "Enable Analytics"

### "Events showing as 0"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're deployed to Vercel (not localhost)
2. Visit your site and navigate pages
3. Wait 10 minutes
4. Refresh dashboard

### "Want more tracking"

**Solution:** Add custom events (see Advanced section above)

## What You Should Do Now

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Test Build Locally (Optional)

```bash
npm run build
```

Should complete without errors.

### 3. Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel Analytics tracking"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Monitor Deployment

Watch the Vercel Dashboard as it:
- Installs dependencies (including @vercel/analytics)
- Builds your app
- Deploys to production
- Activates analytics

### 5. Visit Your Site

After deployment, visit your live site and click around to generate some analytics data.

### 6. Check Analytics Dashboard

After 10 minutes:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select Go Sintra project
3. Click Analytics tab
4. See your data! üìä
